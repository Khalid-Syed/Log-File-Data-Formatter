# Log-File-Data-Formatter
This Python tool takes the log files generated from a system and converts it into csv format for better readability and data manipulation. If the date and time column are merged into 2 column, this tool separates them into two different columns, allowing for quicker data visualisation instead of spending time in cleaning the data.
